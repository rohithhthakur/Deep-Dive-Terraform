### STATE EXAMPLE

# Initialize the environment using the networking bucket and Mary's keys
# Change TABLE_NAME and NET_BUCKET_NAME to the values from the prerequisite output
terraform init --backend-config="dynamodb_table=TABLE_NAME" --backend-config="bucket=BUCKET_NAME" --backend-config="profile=marymoe"

terraform plan -out net.tfplan

# Now change the nat gateway setting to true and open a second terminal window

# In the second terminal window go to the 3-networking2 folder

# Run the same terraform init command from above

# Go back to terminal 1 and run terraform plan to update the nat gateway value

terraform plan -out net.tfplan

# Run the terraform apply command in terminal 1

terraform apply "net.tfplan"

# While that's running, switch to terminal 2 and run a terraform plan

terraform plan -out net2.tfplan

# You should get an error acquiring locking state

# Wait until the apply finished in terminal 1 and then re-run plan in terminal 2

# This should be successful, close terminal 2
